# recruitment_project
this is my totally awesome goated recruitment data project

the organization.py is for organizing the pnms into their RC groups for withdraws/snap bids
the proj.py is the important bit, where the pnms are sorted based on scores and overall rounds (sisterhood, chapter, etc.) and highlighted as well
