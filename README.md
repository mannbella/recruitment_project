# recruitment_project
this is my totally awesome goated recruitment data project

* the organization.py is for organizing the pnms into their RC groups for withdraws/snap bids
* the proj.py is the important bit, where the pnms are sorted based on scores and overall rounds (sisterhood, chapter, etc.) and highlighted as well
* the dated folders are from test runs, has past/test input files and output files
* all the actual input/output is in assorted folders, organized based on overall rounds (sisterhood, chapter, etc.)
